                <p>I received my M.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Appalachian State University in 2016. 
                    My research explored the effects of spatial scale and genotypic diversity of <em>Solidago altissima</em> 
                    on the associated insect pollinator community. Simply put, I examined the differences in the phytochemistry 
                    among individual plants and how those differences influenced pollinators. 
                </p>
                
                <p> I am also an artist/maker and small business owner, having started my sole proprietorship of Calathea Collection 
                    in the summer of 2018. Everything that I create is related to plants in some way. I have been painting with acrylic 
                    since 2004 and have more recently begun experimenting with watercolor and gouache; I use cement to make small 
                    planters (this is quickly becoming my favorite aspect of my business!), and I make macrame plant hangers. You could 
                    say that my brand is an ode to the plant kingdom.
